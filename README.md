# resume-job-posting-nlp-project
Starter repository for the Manning liveProject "Using Online Job Postings to Improve Your Data Science Resume".

# Setup
This liveProject uses Python 3.7, and it's recommend to use the [Anaconda Python Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section).  Once you have Anaconda installed, you can run `conda env create -f environment.yml` to create a conda environment called `job-posting-nlp`.  Then you can activate the environment with `conda activate job-posting-nlp`, and deactivate the environment with `conda deactivate`.  Once you have activated the environment, you can run Jupyter Notebooks from within that terminal window with `jupyter notebook`, and begin working on the project.

# Data
The data is contained within the data folder in a zip file.  Unzip the file to find a directory containing job posting HTML files.  Be sure to check for duplicate job postings!
